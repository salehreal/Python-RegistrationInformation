Description:
I wrote a project titled registration and deletion of students by the administrator, which includes 3 Python files, project, test_project and DataBaseFunction, which I wrote with the pyqt tool.
This project includes 2 databases. One to register the information of the manager and the other to register the information of the students.
I also did the graphic design of the software with qtdesigner, whose files are available in the ui folder.
This project includes 4 entry forms, registration, registration and student information form. The DataBaseFunction file is involved in creating two databases.
The database related to the administrator includes the information of username, password, personnel code and phone number.
The database of students includes academic year, name, surname, class, gender, father's name, national code, mobile number and address.
This information is recorded separately for each student. But if the student's national code is duplicated, an error is encountered and it is said that the student is registered.
On the page of receiving information, if the incorrect phone number is encountered, the administrator. Also, if the password is less than 6 characters, an error will be received.
The test_project file also tests three of the functions in the project file.
